### **Project Proposal: Ticket Management System**

**Project Title**: **Support Ticket Management System**

**Objective**: Develop a web-based ticket management system to streamline the process of handling support requests and internal issues, using React.js for the frontend and Firebase with Firestore for real-time data management and authentication.

**Scope**:
1. **Frontend**: User interface built with React.js.
2. **Backend**: Managed with Firebase services, including Firestore for the database and Firebase Authentication for user management.

**Features**:
1. **User Authentication**:
   - Sign up, login, and authentication using Firebase Authentication.
   - Secure access for users and support agents.

2. **Ticket Creation**:
   - Form for submitting new support tickets with fields for description, category, and priority.
   - Real-time updates and validation.

3. **Ticket Management**:
   - Dashboard for viewing and managing tickets.
   - Real-time updates of ticket status (e.g., Open, In Progress, Resolved).
   - Search and filter capabilities for easy navigation.

4. **Real-Time Data Handling**:
   - Live updates of ticket status and user interactions using Firestoreâ€™s real-time capabilities.

5. **Notifications**:
   - Alerts for new tickets and status changes (optional).

**Technology Stack**:
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore for database, Firebase Authentication for user management)
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting

**Implementation Plan**:
1. **Setup**:
   - Create Firebase project and configure Firestore and Authentication.
   - Initialize React.js project.

2. **Development**:
   - Implement user authentication.
   - Develop ticket submission and management components.
   - Integrate Firestore for data storage and real-time updates.

3. **Testing**:
   - Conduct unit and integration testing to ensure functionality and reliability.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application using Firebase Hosting.

5. **Maintenance**:
   - Provide ongoing support and updates based on user feedback.
